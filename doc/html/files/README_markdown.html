gpgr - GNU Privacy Guard Encryption in Ruby March 2010, Ryan Stenhouse
&lt;ryan@ryanstenhouse.eu&gt; on behalf of [Purchasing Card Consultancy
Limited][1]
</p>
<p>
#About
</p>
<p>
gpgr is a lightweight and fast wrapper around the <tt>gpg</tt> command
commonly found on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.
</p>
<p>
It is only concerned with quickly and easily encrypting files, to that end
aside from some basic key-management support, it will not wrap any other
parts of the gpg functionality.
</p>
<p>
If you need something that will elegantly and quickly encrypt files for you
and make managing the keys used within your application for this purpose a
snap, use this. If not, use something else.
</p>
<p>
#Installation
</p>
<p>
From Rubygems:
</p>
<pre>
        gem install gpgr
</pre>
<p>
From GitHub:
</p>
<pre>
        Download or Clone the repoistory or just gpgr.rb and include it where
        you need it.
</pre>
<p>
#Requirements
</p>
<p>
gpgr has only really been tested on *nix environments, and indeed the path
hard-coded by default for the gpg binary will only be meaningful if
you&#8216;re using a Linux-based or other UNIX-like operating system.
</p>
<p>
The only requirement (apart, obviously, from Ruby) is that you have gpg
installed. On most modern Linux distributions, it should be there by
default to verify, open a terminal and key in:
</p>
<p>
<tt>gpg &#8212;version</tt>
</p>
<p>
If you see something like:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre&gt;
</p>
<pre>
        ryan@ubuntu:~$ gpg --version
        gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.6

        Supported algorithms:
        Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA
        Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH

</pre>
<p>
&lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
Congratulations.
</p>
<p>
For **Ubuntu / Debian** distros, you can try the following if its not
installed by default:
</p>
<p>
<tt>sudo aptitude install seahorse gpg-rsa gpgkeys gpgsm gpgv</tt>
</p>
<p>
As well as installing the command-line tools gpgr expects, seahorse which,
is a fantastic graphical tool for managing your keys, will be installed
</p>
<p>
For **Mac OS X**, you will first need to install <tt>gpg</tt>, you can do
this through MacPorts or Frink, but the best way is through [MacGPG][2],
just
</p>
<dl>
<dt>download the latest version][3</dt><dd>and install int <tt>.pkg</tt> file it downloads.

</dd>
</dl>
<p>
#A Note on Testing
</p>
<p>
Since gpgr really is just firing of to the GPG binary to all of the real
work, there is little to test within gpgr itself. I&#8216;ve added the
tests I feel are prudent and useful. Feel free to contribute your own if
you think a particular area could do with higher coverage.
</p>
<p>
I do take the view, however, that GPG it&#8216;s self is a very well
established and proven, mature project; and as such - any tests which
attempt to test that <b>gpg</b> is functioning correctly will not be
accepted - I&#8216;m happy to assume that it is.
</p>
<p>
#Status
</p>
<p>
Functional if sparsely documented. Gem 0.0.1 has been cut.
