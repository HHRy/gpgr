#gpgr - GNU Privacy Guard Encryption in Ruby 
March 2010, Ryan Stenhouse <ryan@ryanstenhouse.eu> on behalf of [Purchasing
Card Consultancy Limited][1]

##About

gpgr is a lightweight and fast wrapper around the <tt>gpg</tt> command
commonly found on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

It is only concerned with quickly and easily encrypting files, to that
end aside from some basic key-management support, it will not wrap any
other parts of the gpg functionality.

If you need something that will elegantly and quicly encrypt files for
you and make managing the keys used within your application for this 
purpose a snap, use this. If not, use something else.

##Status

Very much a work-in-progress.
